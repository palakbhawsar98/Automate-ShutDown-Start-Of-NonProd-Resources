# Automate-ShutDown-Start-Of-NonProd-Resources
In this project, we will see how we can automate the process of shutting down idle resources in a non-prod environment. Often, we have different environments for testing, but we keep them running all the time, even though we only need them occasionally. This can lead to unnecessary costs. To save costs, we can automate the shutdown process using AWS EventBridge and Lambda functions. We can schedule the shutdown of resources during weekends, non-testing periods, or non-business hours.
